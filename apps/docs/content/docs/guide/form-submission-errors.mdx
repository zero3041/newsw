## Usage

Submission errors generally fall into two categories: field-specific errors and general form errors. Here’s a common approach to display both types:

- For field-specific errors, use `setSubmitErrors`.
- For general form errors, simply display a toast message.
    <ComponentPreview name="RecFormSubmissionErrors" className="max-w-[350px] mx-auto" />
