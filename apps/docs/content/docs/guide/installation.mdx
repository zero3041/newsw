description: Get started with Base Stack using the CLI tool to create a new project
---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - version 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - package manager
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - version control system

## Quick Start

Create a new Base Stack application using the CLI tool:

```bash
npx base-stack@latest init
```

## Project Structure

After running the CLI, you'll get a project with:

```text
my-project/
├── apps/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── [your-app]/
├── packages/
│   ├── eslint-config/
│   ├── typescript-config/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── ui/
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── turbo.json
```

- `apps` Contains all application projects in the monorepo.
- `apps/docs` The documentation site for your project.
- `apps/[your-app]` A placeholder for your main application(s).
- `packages` Holds shared code and configuration packages.
- `packages/eslint-config` Custom shared ESLint configuration for code linting.
- `packages/typescript-config` Shared TypeScript configuration files.
- `packages/lib` Contains shared libraries used throughout your applications, like API clients.
- `packages/ui` A reusable component library for your applications.

## Development

<MdxTip>
    If you can't run `pnpm install`, it might be because you haven't initialized `git` or `git` isn't installed on your
    machine. Since this project uses `lefthook` to automatically format code on every commit, make sure to initialize a
    `git` repository before running `pnpm install`{' '}
</MdxTip>

Navigate to your new project and start development:

```bash
cd ./my-project
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To build your project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```
