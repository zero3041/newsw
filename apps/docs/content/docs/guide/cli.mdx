---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx base-stack@latest
```

## Create New Project

Use the `init` command to quickly scaffold a new Base Stack monorepo.
This sets up the project structure, and gets you ready to start building.

```bash
npx base-stack@latest init
```

**Arguments:**

- `<dir>`: The name of the directory for your new project
- `<app>`: The name of the initial application to create

**Options:**

- `-s, --stack <stack>`: Framework stack (`next`, `tanstack-router`)
- `-g, --init-git`: Initialize git repository (default: true)

**With options:**

```bash
npx base-stack@latest init my-project web --stack next
```

## Add A New Application

In many cases, your project may require both a client-facing app and an internal app such as an admin. The `add` command allows you to quickly generate an additional application.

```bash
npx base-stack@latest add
```

**Arguments:**

- `<app>`: The name of the application to add

**Options:**

- `-s, --stack <stack>`: Framework stack


**With Options**

```bash
npx base-stack@latest add admin --stack next
```
